# üõ† Running the App

### ‚úÖ Requirements:
- Java 21+
- PostgreSQL installed and running

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Initialization:
Run the database setup script:

#### On Windows:
```powershell
./scripts/init.ps1
```

#### On Linux/macOS:

```bash
bash scripts/init.sh
```

These scripts will create the schema and populate it using the SQL files in `scripts/db/`, including:

```
create.sql      -- Table definitions
fill.sql        -- Default data (countries, roles, datasets, etc.)
triggers.sql    -- Postgres triggers (optional)
```

> Make sure PostgreSQL is running and accessible before executing the script.

### üèÉ Running the App

You can run the app either:

* From **IntelliJ** using the `javafx:run` plugin, or
* From the **JAR file** via the command line.

> ‚úÖ **Windows**: The JavaFX SDK ZIP is already included and unpacks automatically.
> 
> üêß **Linux/macOS**: Download the appropriate JavaFX SDK from [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) and extract it manually.

**Windows**:

```bash
java --module-path ".\javafx-sdk-17.0.15\lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics -jar ai-playground.jar
```

**Linux** (adjust JavaFX path accordingly):

```bash
java --module-path "./javafx-sdk-17.0.15/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics -jar ai-playground.jar
```

# üß± Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern:

- **Model**: Core neural network logic and data structures (custom implementation in Java)
- **View**: JavaFX-based UI
- **ViewModel**: Connects UI to business logic, enabling clean separation of concerns

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: JavaFX (Desktop UI)
- **Core Logic & ViewModels**: Java
- **Neural Networks**: Implemented from scratch (no external ML libraries)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## üß† Core Package

The `core` package contains the fundamental logic for building and training neural networks ‚Äî fully implemented in Java without external machine learning libraries.

### Key Components:

- **`NeuralNet`** ‚Äì Manages model architecture, training loop, and callbacks.
- **`Tensor`** ‚Äì Custom multidimensional array with automatic differentiation support.
- **`ComputationalGraph`** ‚Äì Handles gradient calculation via a topologically sorted DAG.
- **`Dataset`** ‚Äì Loads, splits, and prepares data from disk into tensors.

### Submodules:

- **`layers`** ‚Äì Implementations of layers like `Linear`, `ReLU`, `Dropout`, etc.
- **`optim`** ‚Äì Optimizers including `SGD`, `Adam`, `RMSProp`, etc.
- **`loss`** ‚Äì Loss functions such as `MSE`, `CrossEntropy`, `BCE`.
- **`evalMetric`** ‚Äì Accuracy and other evaluation metrics.
- **`examples`** ‚Äì Sample neural networks showcasing library usage.

## üß∞ Services & Repositories

Services encapsulate business logic and data validation, and delegate raw SQL/database operations to their respective repositories. Each service corresponds to a key domain of the application.

### Main Services:

- **`UserService`**, **`TokenService`** ‚Äì Manage user lifecycle, authentication, token balances, and transactions.
- **`ModelService`** ‚Äì Allows creating and modifying models with versioning support.
- **`TrainingService`** ‚Äì Controls training sessions and stores training metrics.
- **`LeaderboardService`** ‚Äì Provides public result sharing and leaderboard computation.

Each service uses a repository (`UserRepository`, `ModelRepository`, etc.) built with **jOOQ** and **raw SQL**. The database layer is abstracted, so it can be swapped with another implementation if needed.

Services handle exceptions (like `DatabaseException`) and validate all user input, often using Form DTOs (e.g. `LoginForm`, `RegisterForm`) that are first checked against regex patterns, then against database state.

## üì§ Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

The `dto` package defines record types and enums that carry structured data between the different layers of the application.

### Subpackages:

- **`architecture`** ‚Äì Declarative objects representing model structure:
  - `LayerType`, `LayerParams`, and `LayerConfig` are used to dynamically build and serialize model layers.
  - `OptimizerType`, `LossFunctionType`, `DatasetType` map GUI and DB values to internal logic.
  
- **`form`** ‚Äì User-submitted forms like `LoginForm`, `ModelForm`, `RegisterForm`, etc.
- **`validation`** ‚Äì Classes that validate form input using regex and logical rules.
- **Other DTOs** ‚Äì Include domain-specific records like `ModelDto`, `UserDto`, `TrainingDto`, and `LeaderboardDto`.

DTOs abstract and centralize data passing across the application, ensuring consistency, type safety, and testability.

## ‚ùó Exception Handling

Custom exceptions are used to signal either internal application failures or expected business rule violations.

Examples include:

- **`DatabaseException`** ‚Äì For SQL or data-layer failures.
- **`UserModificationException`**, **`TrainingException`** ‚Äì For failed user actions like invalid login or invalid model setup.
- **`InsufficientTokensException`** ‚Äì Triggered when a user lacks tokens to perform an action.
- **`ModelModificationException`**, etc.

These exceptions are caught in view models and surfaced to the user via readable messages in the UI.

## üîó ViewModels

ViewModels act as the glue between the UI and backend logic. They handle input events from the GUI, transform DTOs, interact with services, and expose observable properties for real-time UI updates.

- **`UserViewModel`**, **`TokenViewModel`** ‚Äì Manage user accounts, login/register, and token economy.
- **`MainViewModel`** ‚Äì Central to the app: manages model editing, training, versioning, and metrics tracking.
- **`TokenViewModel`** ‚Äì Manages the token shop, token balance, and transactions.
- **`LeaderboardViewModel`** ‚Äì Displays and filters global and local leaderboards.
- **`ViewModelFactory`** ‚Äì Simplifies dependency injection and construction of view models across scenes.

Each ViewModel wraps backend services and exposes clean interfaces for the UI.

## üé® View (JavaFX)

The View layer is implemented using **JavaFX**, with `.fxml` files describing layouts and matching controller classes handling interactions.

Controllers:
- Bind UI elements (e.g. labels, tables, buttons) to ViewModel properties.
- Listen to user events and forward them to ViewModels.
- React to ViewModel state changes (e.g. updating a plot during training)
- Dynamically generate UI elements for neural network layers using `LayerType` enums.

Thanks to `LayerConfig` and other DTOs, **no specific layer logic is hardcoded in the UI**. This makes the app modular and easily extensible with new types of layers or training configurations.
